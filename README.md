Universal React Native Boilerplate - a bare bones combination of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), and [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)

A simple boilerplate to write one app that runs on web, iOS, and Android!

TL;DR:
`git clone https://github.com/mikebars/universal-react-native-boilerplate.git`
`cd universal-react-native-boilerplate`
`yarn`
```
# run web project in dev server
yarn run start-web
```
```
# start ios project in emulator
yarn run start-ios
```
```
# start android project in (already running) emulator
yarn run start-android
```
```
# build web project for production
yarn run build
```
```
# test application
yarn test
```
